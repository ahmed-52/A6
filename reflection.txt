## Verification questions

1. Approximately how much faster does your app finish processing the clocktower
   image when using your `HeapMinQueue` vs. the `RefMinQueue`?  (with assertions
   disabled)

   Answer: HeapMinQueue is about 4 times faster than RefMinQueue.

## Reflection questions

1. When completing A5, did you make any assumptions specific to point-to-point
   selections that you had to relax or fix in order to work with A6's new
   selection model?  What do you think would be a good technique to help
   developers avoid assuming things beyond what's specified in an interface?

   Answer: I did not make any assumptions specific to point-to-point selections in A5. We can
   avoid assuming things beyond what's specified in an interface by carefully reading the
   interface documentation and ensuring that our implementation adheres to the interface
   requirements.

2. Describe your custom weigher(s) and what inspired you to do the calculations
   that you did.

   Answer: In the ColorWeight implementation, I analyzed gradients across each color band of
    the image to determine the maximum gradient, reflecting significant changes in any color
    channel. This method effectively captures edges in images with distinct color differences but
    similar brightness levels, enhancing the segmentation accuracy for colored images.

3. What is your favorite thing you learned or accomplished in CS 2110?

   Answer: Heaps and priority queues.
